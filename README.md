projects, and vote on whether you think it should be synthesizable (or, at least, whether it is worth trying!)

Currently uses [crystaltoolkit](https://docs.crystaltoolkit.org) and data from the
[OPTIMADE API](https://optimade.org) from the recent [Google DeepMind
paper](https://github.com/google-deepmind/materials_discovery).
